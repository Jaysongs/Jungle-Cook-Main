# Notes to the developer - 
This application allows you to...


To develop this website you will need to use npm init
sass files are separated by page, and this project uses an MVC model
There is javascript that allows the user to add more ingredients and instructions when creating their recipe
The login page uses Firebase to log users in and sign them up. If the Firebase does not recognize your log in credentials, the signup button is more lenient and will let you view your recipes.
There sadly is no CRUD so users cannot save/edit a recipe
